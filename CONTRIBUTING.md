# Contributing to Conclave

We encourage you to contribute to Conclave and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Got a Question or Problem?](#got-a-question-or-problem)
 - [Found a Bug?](#found-a-bug)
 - [Missing a Feature?](#missing-a-feature)
 - [Submission Guidelines](#submission-guidelines)
 - [Signing the CLA](#signing-the-cla)


## Got a Question or Problem?
Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.
Instead, we recommend using [Discord](https://discord.gg/zpHKkMZ8Sw) or joining our [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/conclave-discuss) to ask our
engineering team directly. You can also check if there's an answer to your question on [StackOverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/conclave).


## Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github].
Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request-pr) with a fix. If you are just getting started with Conclave, search for issues labelled 
“good first issue”.


## Missing a Feature?
Feature requests are welcome! You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please follow the contribution process:
first open an issue and then outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it can be successfully integrated into the project.


## Submission Guidelines
### Submitting an Issue
Before submitting an issue, please search for it using the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. When describing an issue, it is recommended that you provide as much information as possible to resolve the issue quickly. Whenever possible, provide a reproducing use case. It allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:
1. Search [GitHub][github] for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.
2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
   We cannot accept code without a signed CLA. Make sure you author all contributed Git commits with email address associated with your CLA signature. 
3. Fork the project, set up the development environment, make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to your commits.
4. Push your branch to GitHub and send PR to `R3Conclave/conclave-core-sdk:master`.
5. Before the PR can be considered, you must have first signed our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](#signing-the-cla).


#### Addressing review feedback
During the review process, we may ask you to make changes to your contribution before accepting it. If we do request changes from you, please observe the following steps:
1. Make the required updates to the code.
2. Re-run the Conclave test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
3. Create a fixup commit and push to your GitHub repository.
You made it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged
After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.


## Signing the CLA
For any code changes to be accepted, you must have first signed our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). If you're 
an individual contributor this is a quick process. In your PR the `CLAassistant` bot will ask you to sign
the Individual CLA, which you can read and sign by following the link.

If you're a corporate contributor (i.e. you're contributing your changes as part of your employment) then we first
need to have an Corporate CLA in place with your employer. Please ask the relevant person in your organisation to 
fill in [this form](https://airtable.com/shrL0RtDVKwgBEYWS). Once we have that and the Corporate CLA is signed we 
can whitelist your organisation for contributions.

If you have more than one GitHub account, or multiple email addresses associated with a single GitHub account, you must sign the CLA using the primary email address of the GitHub account used to author your commits and send pull requests.
