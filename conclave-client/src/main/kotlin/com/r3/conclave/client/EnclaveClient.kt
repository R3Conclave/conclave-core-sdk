/**
 * Represents a client of an enclave. [EnclaveClient] manages the encryption of requests that
 * need to be sent to an enclave ([sendMail]), and using an [EnclaveTransport], transports encrypted mail to the
 * host for delivery to the enclave. It also provides a polling mechanism with [pollMail] for retrieving any
 * asychronous responses from the enclave.
 *
 * Creating a new client instance requires providing an [EnclaveConstraint] object. This acts as an identity of the
 * enclave and is used to check that the client is communicating with the intended one. A private encryption key is also
 * required. There is an constructor overload which creates a random new one for you, or you can use
 * [Curve25519PrivateKey.random](https://docs.conclave.net/api/-conclave%20-core/com.r3.conclave.mail/-curve25519-private-key/random.html)
 * to create a new random one yourself.
 *
 * After creating a new client, users will need to call [start] and provide an [EnclaveTransport] for communicating with
 * the host. Which implemenation of [EnclaveTransport] is used will depend on the network transport between the client
 * and host. If the host is using the `conclave-web-host` server then users can use
 * [com.r3.conclave.client.web.WebEnclaveTransport] for the transport.
 *
 * ### Sending and receiving Mail
 *
 * After starting the client is able to send mail to the enclave using [sendMail]. [EnclaveClient] will encrypt the body
 * and optional envelope with the private encryption key and then pass the encrypted bytes onto the provided
 * [EnclaveTransport] to deliver it to the host. [sendMail] can optionally return back a decrypted [EnclaveMail] which
 * is the synchronous response from the enclave, if it produced one.
 *
 * For receiving asychronous responses, i.e. those which the enclave produces for the client but which are produced
 * due to other clients, [pollMail] will return the next asynchronous response if one is available.
 *
 * ### Thread safety
 *
 * [EnclaveClient] is not thread-safe. [sendMail] and [pollMail] must be called from the same thread. If the client
 * wants to poll for asychronous mail in a background thread then that same thread must also be used for sending mail.
 * A simple way to achieve this is to use a single-threaded [ScheduledExecutorService]. The following (incomplete) code
 * sample shows how this might be done.
 *
 * ```java
 *     ScheduledExecutorService singleThreadWorker = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
 *     BlockingQueue<EnclaveMail> receivedMail = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
 *
 *     private ScheduledFuture<?> pollingTask;
 *
 *     void start() throws InvalidEnclaveException, IOException {
 *          enclaveClient.start(enclaveTransport);
 *          pollingTask = singleThreadWorker.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
 *              try {
 *                  EnclaveMail mail = enclaveClient.pollMail();
 *                  if (mail != null) {
 *                      receivedMail.add(mail);
 *                  }
 *              } catch (IOException e) {
 *                  throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
 *              }
 *          }, 0, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  // Poll every 5 seconds
 *     }
 *
 *     Future<EnclaveMail> sendMail(byte[] body) {
 *          return singleThreadWorker.submit(() -> enclaveClient.sendMail(body));
 *     }
 *
 *     void close() throws IOException {
 *          if (pollTask != null)
 *              pollingTask.cancel(true);
 *          enclaveClient.close();
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Enclave rollback
 *
 * One key security feature [EnclaveClient] provides is detection of rollback attacks by the host on the enclave. This
 * type of attack is where the host restarts the enclave but in an older state. The enclave itself is unable to detect
 * this but it can leverage its clients so that they may detect it. However not all clients may detect the rollback, but
 * at least some will.
 *
 * Detection is enabled by default in [EnclaveClient]. However it's only detected when the client next receives mail
 * which is why [sendMail] and [pollMail] can throw [EnclaveRollbackException]. What action needs to be taken depends on
 * the client's security policy but it may include contacting other clients (if any are known) or maybe even the enclave
 * host if there is genuine foul play and they can be brought to account. It's also important to note a rollback can
 * arise from a genuine mistake if the host accidently restarted the enclave from an old state.
 *
 * The client can continue to be used to send and receive mail after an [EnclaveRollbackException] is thrown. However
 * the state of the client and the state of the enclave are probably now out of sync and further communication with the
 * enclave may be unsafe. If rollback attacks are not a concern at all then detection for it can be turned off
 * completely by overriding [ignoreEnclaveRollback] to return true. The same security caveats apply.
 *
 * ### Restarts
 *
 * [EnclaveClient] is designed to handle both enclave and client restarts. If the enclave restarts then its encryption
 * key changes but [EnclaveClient] will automatically switch to the new encryption key when it detects this.
 * Notifications for restarts can be enabled by overriding [onEnclaveRestarted]. This might be needed if the enclave is
 * non-persistent and the client needs to re-submit their data. It could also be used as an indication of a rollback
 * attack.
 *
 * To support client restarts the state of [EnclaveClient] must be persisted and then restored. Failing to do this will
 * prevent the client from sending or receive mail due to spurious errors. To this end, [save] can be used to serialize
 * the state of the client which can be restored using the [EnclaveClient] constructor that takes in a byte array.
 * This is provided solely as a convenience and the state of the client can be persisted any other way. See the [save]
 * documentation for more details.
 *
 * ### PostOffice
 *
 * [EnclaveClient] is an extension to [PostOffice] and provides features it cannot support. If these features are not
 * needed and you simply need to send a one-off mail, for example, then use [EnclaveInstanceInfo.createPostOffice] to
 * create a post office for encrypting requests and decrypting any responses.
